Pypsum is available only for Linux, at the moment. 
On Linux, you will need python (I have 2.5.2, might work with other versions, too) 
with the following modules: urllib2, 
xml.sax (for the command line tool), gtk, gtk.glade (for the graphical interface). 
Most modern Linux distributions (like Ubuntu) have these ready installed.
You can get Pypsum from the Downloads tab, or, if you prefer, the Source tab.
